BeerDroid
=========

This is an ongoing project with the goal to create an android application for accessing information about beer, from multiple sources, through a simple and practical interface, while "on the go".

On the server side a rails server is used to gather and format data in a practical JSON format for the android application.

Getting started
===============

* Install ruby on rails
* Set up the android build environment
* Get this source from github
* Remove the .template from android/src/com/beerdroid/beta/Config.java.template
  and change any needed options.

Rails paths and functionality
=============================

The links from paths to controllers are in /rails/config/routes.rb
The implementation and detailed description of return format is in /rails/app/controllers/home_controller.rb

The following paths are implemented in rails:

Path => returns
find_ba_id_google/:query/:nr => :nr beeradvocate ids for the search term :query
get_ba_by_name/:query => beeradvocate information for the search term :query. Only first hit.
get_ba_by_id/:brewery/:id.:format => beeradvocate information for the given beeradvocate ids in :format
get_systemet_by_name/:query => systembolaget information for the given search term
get_systemet_by_name/:query/:county => systembolaget information for the given search term in county
supersearch/:query => All info available for all beers found with :query
supersearch/:query/:county => All info available for all beers found with :query, with systembolaget info for :county
get_ba_brewery_by_id/:brewery => beeradvocate brewery info for the :brewery id on beeradvocate
